You are a student that's stayed inside, playing videogames the entire day.
You're trying to go outside for once, but you keep realizing something's wrong right before you leave.

You:
- Forgot the keys in your room.
- Left the oven on?

Using the computer at any time is a loss condition.
Successfully leaving is a win condition.
